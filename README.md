The purpose of this project was for me to apply things I learned in the Neural Networks from Scratch in Python textbook by Harrison Kinsley, Daniel Kukie≈Ça.

This project combines neural networks with my interest in how social media sentiment affects prices.

The project nests a neural network within a neural network. The inner neural network is trained to predict sentiment of general investment topics. The outer neural network is trained to predict a price (Trump coin in this case).

The overarching goal of the predictor is to prevent people from getting scammed by volatile meme coins. 

See PredictTrumpCoin.ipynb. Overall project is about 80% complete
