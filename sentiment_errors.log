# What about 100íxing your investment?

While there are probably hundreds†*(even thousands)*†of coins that might have 100íxed in value during their brief existence†*(like the†Hawk Tuah†coin)*, itís unrealistic to expect to find them and invest in them before someone rug pulls them out of existence.

To get a more realistic scenario, we kept a minimum market cap limit of $10 Million and required the coin to be present in the top 100 coins based on market cap.

The backtest is simple ó At the beginning of every month†*(starting in 2014)*, we check what the top 100 most popular coins were and the probability that you would have 100íxed your investment if you held on to that coin†*(*[data here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r-3jqju58bfewDd2GxfH0jd0woO2kSKYEodFYkf6JB0/edit?usp=sharing)*).*

In the last 10 years, there were a total of 9,502 coins that fit our criteria. Out of these, only 442†*(4.6%)*†grew more than 100x. This assumes that you sold at the very top. If you had held on to these coins to date, the number drops to 160.

**So, over the holding period, the chance that you 100íxed your investment on a coin is only 1.7%.**

If you remove the duplicates†*(as the same coin can come up in our filter in different months),*†of the 460 cryptocurrencies that made it into the list, only 38†*(8%)*†grew more than 100x. If you held on till 2024, only 8 coins†*(1.7%)*†provided you with a 100x return.

While there are probably hundreds†*(even thousands)*†of coins that might have 100íxed in value during their brief existence†*(like the†Hawk Tuah†coin)*, itís unrealistic to expect to find them and invest in them before someone rug pulls them out of existence.

To get a more realistic scenario, we kept a minimum market cap limit of $10 Million and required the coin to be present in the top 100 coins based on market cap.

The backtest is simple ó At the beginning of every month†*(starting in 2014)*, we check what the top 100 most popular coins were and the probability that you would have 100íxed your investment if you held on to that coin†*(*[data here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r-3jqju58bfewDd2GxfH0jd0woO2kSKYEodFYkf6JB0/edit?usp=sharing)*).*

**So, over the holding period, the chance that you 100íxed your investment on a coin is only 1.7%.**

If you remove the duplicates†*(as the same coin can come up in our filter in different months),*†of the 460 cryptocurrencies that made it into the list, only 38†*(8%)*†grew more than 100x. If you held on till 2024, only 8 coins†*(1.7%)*†provided you with a 100x return.

For those who are determined to try to win, here are a few things to consider:

# What are the odds that you will lose 100% of your investment?

Of the more than 40,000 coins that traded in an exchange at least once in the last 10 years, only 38% are still alive. So forget about making a profit ó the probability that the coin you buy will survive over the long run is only \~ 1 in 3.

Firstly I want MicroStrategy to succeed and think Bitcoin will ultimately continue to do so. However I believe people are better to invest in Bitcoin rather than MicroStrategy stock as I believe Saylor's idea is circumstantially flawed.

MicroStrategy's strategy ultimately depends on Bitcoin continuing to appreciate in price over time in line with with historical/ cyclical four year cycle's. Although it's probable it will continue... ultimately no guarantee. Dispite his passion and fancy analogies, the elephant in the room is other altcoins/ forks that harness the exact principles and fundamentals of Bitcoin yet have failed to make fresh all-time highs.

Saylor seems skilled in speaking about/ defending Bitcoin and MicroStrategy's plan.. however one question I'd love to see put him is...  Litecoin, Dogecoin, Bitcoin Cash etc are all founded on the same principle's as Bitcoin and although their price appreciation is loosely correlated with halving cycles.. surely they are hard evidence that future new highs are no guarantee? 

So just to be clear, Bitcoin forks highlight new highs are not necessarily made every cycle, however the network adjust the mining difficulty and the projects survive.

Validation error for post 'Litecoin delivers 300,000,000th transaction today after 13 years of 100% uptime. It's rare to find any real fundamentals in crypto, much less long term relative growing fundamentals in a coin with bad relative price action. Litecoin is deep clucking value. It's worth digging into the transaction growth trends over the past few years. There's only one altcoin, only one dino with sustained real world user growth and adoption vs everything, even against Bitcoin. It's Litecoin.  

The nice thing about Litecoin is you can confirm onchain data using offchain data. With premined smart contracts you have two layers of deception in the data. First is outright fraud. Preminers can't sell without collapsing the mcap of their chain, but they can put coins into the contracts and just spin them around to create the illusion that there's more activity than there is. They can also use the value of the premine to temporarily support unsustainable incentives, yield farming.   

Real world adoption can be seen offchain as well as onchain, in exchanges, payment processors, retailers, banks, brokerages, atms and the like. Most coins get just enough infrastructure and struggle to add more. Litecoin has over the past few years kept pace with the likes of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin in terms of additions, without the billionaire support, just with users. Sustained additions suggest there's ample liquidity to make it worth retaining support and adding more.  

Over the last few years, Litecoin has added Paypal, Venmo, Paxos, Verifone, bitpay, AMC, Regal, Newegg, Flexa, Gemini, Interactive Brokers, Coinshares, Wisdom Tree, Grayscale, Shopify, Moneygram, postfinance, bitgo, Wisdomtree, Coinme, EDX, Fidelity and even banks like BBVA, BanColumbia and CBA. It's first US ETF application was filed by Canary Capital late last year. That's above and beyond the table stakes of near universal exchange support.  

Among entities reporting user share, Litecoin has really excelled. Litecoin remains the top altcoin among ATMs worldwide, which you can see at coinatmradar. Litecoin has grown it's share at outlets like Coingate and Bitrefill. Most impressively, Litecoin has done at the oldest crypto payment processor what no alt has ever done and taken the top slot from Bitcoin.  

Bitpay, around since 2011, dragged its feet adding Litecoin for years adding other alts, then in 2021 it finally added LTC. It took LTC 3 months to exceed all other altcoin's share. It took maybe a year to exceed all altcoins combined. Then 2 years in it exceeded Bitcoin's share for the first time and last year exceeded Bitcoin's share the entire year, without interruption.  

Litecoin is the values compatible Medium of Transaction companion to Bitcoin's Store of Value. No other coin combines the no premine, fair distribution, algo dominant PoW, fixed supply, global network effect growth with affordable fees. You don't have to hope the centralized preminers don't rug and kill it, they can't because Litecoin shares Bitcoin's decentralization priority. You can see the substitution over the years whenever Bitcoin fees rise, so it's not my opinion, it's the opinion of Bitcoin users drawn to it for the same values. I'd encourage everyone to follow wlitecoin on Twitter/x to learn more about monetization limits and the onchain stats comparisons.  

Litecoin is the boring financial plumbing that has proven it can't be killed by sustained investor hostility, or even slowed. Negative narratives will persist until they fall apart, and the narratives don't match the adoption. 2025 could be ≈Åit.': Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)

Validation error for post 'US crypto hodlers: You have about 2 weeks before the 1099-DA goes into effect. Just a friendly reminder:

Starting January 1st, 2025 (in 2 weeks), all US exchanges (e.g. Kraken, Coinbase) will start reporting your crypto transactions directly to the IRS via the [1099-DA](https://gordonlaw.com/learn/form-1099-da/).

For pretty much the entire existence of crypto so far, US users have had to self report crypto gains on their taxes (many didn't, or simply underreport). But if you have any sale transactions next year (2025) within the exchange of your choosing, they will automatically be reported to the IRS.

Especially noteworthy: If you have coins that you've held for a long time (e.g. from this year or before) and you sell them next year, the IRS will see that you have **$0 cost basis**. And you will have to show them when you acquired your coins (if it's been too long and you somehow can't find these transactions, then too bad, the IRS will just auto-calculate your cost basis as $0).

For example, if you held DOGE from 2020 and your cost basis is $0.002 (and DOGE is now $0.40), you'll have to provide the 2020 transaction where you bought DOGE for $0.002 and pay all the capital gains on the difference. Plus they'll likely audit your other trades from back then and bill you for any other unreported gains.

**TL;DR**: you have about 2 weeks to tidy up your books, lock in your gains, and make sure you have crypto and USD exactly where you want them to be when January 1st rolls around.': Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)

So the question is, are there any coins you can see that could do bad or under-perform significantly? We've seen in past bullruns that even really bad tech, bad tokenomics, bad projects, and useless projects can have huge pumps with the rest of the market, and do really well.

Even coins that had 51% attacks, had scandals, were pretty much scams, still pumped.

But are there any coins that could vastly underperform for a big chunk of the bull market?

# What would it even take for a coin to perform poorly during a bullrun?

In the bullrun of 2021, we only had a few top market cap crypto that ran into problems and vastly underperformed.

ICP was one of the most notable ones.

It go listed on Coinbase, and skyrocketed to over $700 to an insane market cap in a matter of minutes. But then tanked through the entire bullrun.

This was an exceptional case of a bad introductory price point.

Bitcoin BSV had a big pump at the beginning of the bullrun, and then crashed prematurely and never recovered, in a quick pump and dump. It had a series of crises and then started to get delisted.

We saw a few premature crashes for cryptos like GRT.

It's not always for obvious reasons, and more for bad circumstances, making it a little harder to predict.

# Which crypto are more likely to underperform or have a premature crash?

Since it seems to be linked to some nasty surprises more than anything, it's very hard to predict.

If there's anything that's gonna derail, it's more likely a less solid project outside the top 100. There's plenty of crypto there already set up for their own crises.

This doesn't mean the top 100 is immune.

There's some shaky stuff in the top 100.

You already have tokens for questionable exchanges like GateIO.

You have newcomers in the meme world like cat in dog's world, Goatseus Maximus, dogwif hat, and Popcat. I think the meme coin of the SOL ecosystem is one that could really backfire.

And the last couple of months, i began to sell high and buy low, i got some good profit from it and wanted to continue doing it. However, i let myself get hyped up by another coin. I heard it was going up and from what i believe, i thought so too. It's Trump coin. I had my money in nothing since i was waiting for Bitcoin to lower a bit. I put 100k in Trump coin. Immediately i was down 3k, okay whatever, but not only that, just the feeling of "i fucked it up" was there at the back of my mind. A few hours later my brother (who bought it earlier) messaged me saying it was going down to shit. My stomach couldn't handle it and i was affraid to look. I was going to bed stressed and tried to sleep. Today i woke up and saw the damage. I was down -20%. Which isn't that bad since it recovered from -50% in the night. 25k is a little less than a year of salary. So that was a big kick in the nuts. At work, I saw it was still going down, so I sold and put it in Bitcoin again.

- I did not stick with my original plan.

- I let emotions take the better of me.

- I did not do research.

- It let myself get hyped up.

I am very mad at myself and i let myself down. Not only did i lose 25k, I also missed the potential gains from Bitcoin. I already made peace with it and decided to just stick to Bitcoin only, it's what i have done from the beginning and one of the few that actually worked for me. I trust Bitcoin. I'll do what i have always done to repair the damage.

My advice: don't FOMO and actually do research first before throwing your money away. Don't let yourself get hyped up and follow the crowd, it's a trap.

Title says it all. Robinhood has listed Trump Coin for purchase. They only sell 21 crypto tokens, 22 if you count USDC, but less than 3 days after the Trump shit coin was created they have TrumpCoin listed. I've heard rumor that Coinbase is next to list it....all standards have gone out the window it seems. The grift is on full steam ahead, none of them can wait to get in on the rug pull. 

It was clear this shit coin would one day be reality after the trading card fiasco, but even I didn't expect it to rake in $80 billion in days. I doubt even a fraction of that money is coming from MAGA voters, collectively we peasants can't pool our money anywhere near $80 billion and most of us don't know how to work a digital wallet. Is the money coming from privately held companies, foreign nations, Russian oligarchs, all buying favors under the radar? Maybe access to POTUS is going to be based on how many Trump Tokens are you in your digital wallet.

Validation error for post 'Mixed feelings about Strategic Reserve plan Hello guys,

I've been thinking about this strategic reserve plan for a while now and, like most you, got also excited when the "semi-official" announcement came in last Sunday.

Prior to this announcement, there had already been some arguments saying that such a State-owned strategic reserve goes totally against the very purpose of crypto. Originally, the goal of basically all crypto activity was to create an alternative away from governments, decentralizing the systems and empowering the users.

Governments are now seizing these spaces for themselves - be this the main driver or rather other purposes, from downright speculation to reduce their debt or really for the sake of having an alternative reserve without the logistical hassles of gold.

Be it as it may, the whole market seems to have found peace with this and embraced the narrative as it "legitimates" crypto towards the "disbelievers" - and helps pump up the price.

However, the undoubtedly suspicious signs of insider trading happening around the announcement show that the US government's work in favor of crypto has been, at least partially, to enable advantages leveraged by inside information useful for trading (and let me recall that the SEC cannot investigate insider trading on crypto if they're not classified as securities). 

Moreover, choosing coins for the reserve like ADA, SOL, XRP and even ETH that, as good/solid as they might be, were created to serve way different purposes than serving as a reserve asset. Heck, they should have mentioned the TRUMP coin already then. Or DOGE... Anyway, you get the point. 

What I wanna say is that this means that this whole hype around this pro-crypto government might just backfire epically. It will not take long before this kind of episode becomes main topic of a "Last Week Tonight" show and crypto becomes synonym for corruption, which means a legislation crackdown will follow latest after the next elections.

Therefore, I am basically considering this cycle the biggest there will ever be, because everything after 2026 will point towards more legislation, less institutional adoption and/or centralization.

Validation error for post 'Question - Are memecoins not just collectibles? I feel like I should know more about crypto, but I'm mid-50s and perhaps this is the time I start to feel old, lol. :)

With all the talk about the Trump memecoin, aren't these memecoins basically the same thing as other collectibles from the past?  Basically like the same thing as if Marvel Comics  releases a limited run of 500 versions of a comic book with a special variant cover?  Or chase cards in various forms of collectible cards (baseball, pokemon, etc.)?

Except a memecoin has a built in exchange and a way to sell it.  Like if I took a "valuable" comic book and tried to purchase goods or services with it, it would be hard because the other person doesn't know what it is worth.  And they worry there is information asymmetry that might cause them to overvalue the comic book.  Plus, they don't actually want to OWN the comic book and then have to sell it on eBay......which is a pain in the butt and (again) they are not a comic book merchant and might not price it correctly.

Isn't a Trump coin the same basic thing......except it is easy to check the value and easier to convert back into a currency you prefer (like bitcoin or US dollars)?  And with blockchain preventing counterfeiting (which can be a problem with other collectibles)?

Edit - Thanks a lot folks.  You basically confirmed what I suspected.  And - to be clear - I have no interest in buying memecoins.  I did buy comic books in my youth and do remember how valuable some of the old issues got......but that was true rarity.  It was from an era when comics were sold to children and mostly ended up rumpled up in a backpack.  Then the comic companies realized that "collectors" would buy more if they restarted Spider Man with a ALL NEW #1 issue and a bunch of limited edition variants of the #1 issues.....except now it wasn't children buying them.....it was adult men buying them and immediately sending them away to be "graded" and encased in lucite.  And then they would release ANOTHER ALL NEW #1 about 18 months later and the cycle would repeat and repeat......and you can guess how much those "collectible" comics are worth now.  You find them at comic shops in what's called the "dollar box" which is a box were any comic is a $1: It's junk.  I'm sure baseball cards are similar.  Heck, US postage stamps are similar: Postal service mostly prints stamps for collectors now.  I mean....stamps COULD be used on actual mail, but almost none are: Collectors buy them, bring them immediately home and put them in the collection......and they're only worth anything to another collector (who probably also bought them from the post office when they were new, lol).

The soon to be Dept.O.G.E. may  as well just launch a new coin to create their own budget (Elon could easily do this) and never address meme coins again.

Validation error for post 'So no one really knows anything about anything what do we do? Since the news of Trump came into play we have seen crypto do some massive jumps and some serious dives (*cough* Trump coin). Lots of hype again and now that everyone and the mouse under your fridge know what crypto is, speculation is at an all time high. 

What do we really know? 

Trump is favouring crypto and is playing the game to help himself and everyone he knows make money. Trump is a business man do not forget this when you are speculating. With the new order we do not see a massive immediate spike in crypto. So why not? 

1) BTC, XRP and other popular coins already shot up leading into inauguration. If you truely believe big players were not aware of Trump's plans and did not already price in the news (hence spike) then you need to buy into whatever you are debating now. 

2) the order did not specify a coin. Yes it is likely to be BTC or BTC with a combination of other coins.  BUT it's Trump, I wouldn't rule out them going balls to the wall with a random coin but I do think it's unlikely.  However, I also wouldn't rule out him ripping a line and creating some brand new US digital currency to back the economy on and run against BTC. 

3) Japanese interest rate decision. This is coming up tomorrow and there is speculation they are going to raise to a 17 year high. 

So why BTC, ETH or even XRP? 

BTC is BTC everyone knows what it is and it is finite. Like anything society has attributed value to it and it's rarity makes it valuable. This is the logical option and would echo back to the days when the US dollar was backed by gold. I would even dare to say that if the US did not select this as their coin that BTC would still hold value.  Maybe not where it's at now but it will not become worthless. It is worth considering that a lot of big companies are increasing their BTC holdings (MSTR). Betting big with big US companies is a bit comforting. 

ETH is a similar sentiment but has lost a lot of its appeal post COVID but with it being the second runner up I wouldn't rule out it seeing a play in the digital reserves.  It's also possible that if BTC is chosen that ETH could ragain popularity as a secondary cheaper option causing a run. 

What about XRP? This is a coin I hear a lot of positives about. A lot of hopium and a lot of logical arguments for it. It's cheap enough that many hope it will be the next BTC and make overnight millionaires. If you are new to the coin some of the strongest arguments are it's technology. It can settle transactions reliably and quickly posing a real possibility of it being used like your money today. There are other pros but I want to highlight some of the cons. It is still at the centre of a lawsuit...yes it may get dropped but keep it in mind. It's also unclear is XRP is a finite resource  like BTC or ETH and seems to act more like printed money.  Meaning that it can be the victim of inflation. PERSONALLY I would love to see this coin soar but to me it feels like backing a dollar with another dollar.  It just doesn't making sense so me. 

Plainly crypto will not be a sure bet until something is signed saying that XYZ coin(s) are being used as a reserve. You will be gambling if you want to jump into anything crypto right now.  Then again so was everyone that bought into crypto before the boom and that made people very rich. 

I'm not going to tell you do your due diligence as a way cushion what I said above. Do what you want I'm not your parent but if you have a lower risk appetite but still want to gamble on a possible boom I would suggest you start investing in AI instead.

Verse 1
A long, long time ago,
Crypto gains were on the go,
And Bitcoin made us all feel fine.
But then Trump said, "I‚Äôve got a plan,
A coin to save this crypto land,"
And $TRUMP coin launched‚Äîa joke divine.

But January made me shiver,
The blockchain froze; the trades didn‚Äôt deliver.
Bad tweets on my timeline;
My wallet‚Äôs flat‚ÄîI‚Äôm out of time.

I can't remember if I cried,
When $TRUMP coin nosedived worldwide,
But something touched me deep inside,
The day the market died.

Chorus
So bye-bye to my digital pie,
Put my savings in a token that I thought wouldn‚Äôt die.
And good ol‚Äô boys were tweeting ‚ÄúHODL or cry,‚Äù
Saying, ‚ÄúThis‚Äôll moon; just give it a try.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis‚Äôll moon; just give it a try.‚Äù

Verse 2
Did you read the white paper, man?
It promised gains across the land,
But the roadmap seemed a little vague.
And Trump said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the greatest coin,
The best since gold or fillet mignon‚Äî
It‚Äôs huge, believe me; join the brigade!‚Äù

Well, the miners failed, and the servers crashed,
And the blockchain got hacked‚Äîgone in a flash.
No liquidity in sight,

I bought in high; I thought I‚Äôd soar,
Now I can‚Äôt even buy at the store,
And my savings walked right out the door,
The day the market died.

Watched my wallet hit the bottom as I sat there and cried.

Saying, ‚ÄúThis‚Äôll moon; just give it a try.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis‚Äôll moon; just give it a try.‚Äù

Verse 3
Now for months, we‚Äôve all been in despair,

While Doge kept climbing out of spite.
And the SEC came crashing in,
Called $TRUMP coin ‚Äúfraud‚Äù with a knowing grin,
And crypto bros all gave up the fight.

Oh, and as I scrolled the Reddit threads,
I saw the memes of tears unsaid,
No comments could be seen,
On r/Crypto‚Äôs dying stream.

And as the market burned into the night,
I cursed that tweet and the orange light,
That coin destroyed my future bright,
The day the market died.

Chorus
We were singing bye-bye to my digital pie,
Lost it all on $TRUMP coin, now I‚Äôm wondering why.
And good ol‚Äô boys were tweeting ‚ÄúHODL or cry,‚Äù
Saying, ‚ÄúThis‚Äôll moon; just give it a try.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis‚Äôll moon; just give it a try.‚Äù

Outro
I met a guy who mined for gold,
And I asked him if his story‚Äôs told,
But he just frowned and walked away.
I went back home to check my app,
No gains, no hope, just a big collapse,
And my crypto dreams are gone today.

And on Twitter, the users screamed,
‚ÄúWe should‚Äôve stayed with index schemes!‚Äù
Not a word was spoken,
The blockchain‚Äôs broken.

And the man who sold us all the dream,
He‚Äôs golfing now with his NFT team,
And I just sat there, lost in a meme,
The day the market died.

Final Chorus
And we were singing bye-bye to my digital pie,
Should‚Äôve known that $TRUMP coin was a scam in disguise.
And good ol‚Äô boys were tweeting ‚ÄúHODL or die,‚Äù

With all that‚Äôs going on, what‚Äôs the actual probability of getting a 100x return on your investment in the crypto world?

# What are the odds that you will lose 100% of your investment?

Of the more than 40,000 coins that traded in an exchange at least once in the last 10 years, only 38% are still alive. So forget about making a profit ‚Äî the probability that the coin you buy will survive over the long run is only \~ 1 in 3.

[Total number of coins: 40,399 | Source: Market Sentiment Research, CoinGecko](https://preview.redd.it/3den43lgi66e1.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=f13079314237019897f6099b094b53cc56c4425d)

# What about 100‚Äôxing your investment?

While there are probably hundreds¬†*(even thousands)*¬†of coins that might have 100‚Äôxed in value during their brief existence¬†*(like the¬†Hawk Tuah¬†coin)*, it‚Äôs unrealistic to expect to find them and invest in them before someone rug pulls them out of existence.

To get a more realistic scenario, we kept a minimum market cap limit of $10 Million and required the coin to be present in the top 100 coins based on market cap.

The backtest is simple ‚Äî At the beginning of every month¬†*(starting in 2014)*, we check what the top 100 most popular coins were and the probability that you would have 100‚Äôxed your investment if you held on to that coin¬†*(*[data here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r-3jqju58bfewDd2GxfH0jd0woO2kSKYEodFYkf6JB0/edit?usp=sharing)*).*

In the last 10 years, there were a total of 9,502 coins that fit our criteria. Out of these, only 442¬†*(4.6%)*¬†grew more than 100x. This assumes that you sold at the very top. If you had held on to these coins to date, the number drops to 160.

**So, over the holding period, the chance that you 100‚Äôxed your investment on a coin is only 1.7%.**

If you remove the duplicates¬†*(as the same coin can come up in our filter in different months),*¬†of the 460 cryptocurrencies that made it into the list, only 38¬†*(8%)*¬†grew more than 100x. If you held on till 2024, only 8 coins¬†*(1.7%)*¬†provided you with a 100x return.

>

If you are calculating the expected value and think that you will come out ahead¬†*(given you have a \~2% chance of 100x returns)*, you must read [our research on Kelly Criterion.](https://www.marketsentiment.co/p/the-problem-with-averages)

For those who are determined to try to win, here are a few things to consider:

1. **Be aware of the odds**¬†‚Äî The chance of you hitting a 100x return on your meme coin investment is less than 1 in 50. To put this in perspective, it‚Äôs like picking a specific card out of a shuffled deck of cards on your first try!
2. **Spread your bets ‚Äî**¬†The best way to improve your odds of winning is to survive. You can reduce your risk and improve your returns by¬†[diversifying and making smart bet sizes.](https://www.marketsentiment.co/p/shannons-demon)': Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)

Validation error for post 'Litecoin and Dogecoin are examples why MicroStrategy could easily go bust. Appreciate at first thought you might be i like wtf are you taking about? However, please hear me out.

Firstly I want MicroStrategy to succeed and think Bitcoin will ultimately continue to do so. However I believe people are better to invest in Bitcoin rather than MicroStrategy stock as I believe Saylor's idea is circumstantially flawed.

MicroStrategy's strategy ultimately depends on Bitcoin continuing to appreciate in price over time in line with with historical/ cyclical four year cycle's. Although it's probable it will continue... ultimately no guarantee. Dispite his passion and fancy analogies, the elephant in the room is other altcoins/ forks that harness the exact principles and fundamentals of Bitcoin yet have failed to make fresh all-time highs.

Saylor seems skilled in speaking about/ defending Bitcoin and MicroStrategy's plan.. however one question I'd love to see put him is...  Litecoin, Dogecoin, Bitcoin Cash etc are all founded on the same principle's as Bitcoin and although their price appreciation is loosely correlated with halving cycles.. surely they are hard evidence that future new highs are no guarantee? 

So just to be clear, Bitcoin forks highlight new highs are not necessarily made every cycle, however the network adjust the mining difficulty and the projects survive.

Similarly if bitcoin ever fails to make fresh new highs it will survive... however MicroStrategy goes bust.

Although I applaud Saylor and MicroStrategy, this is exactly the reason I'd hold Bitcoin rather than their stock. ': Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)

Validation error for post 'Litecoin delivers 300,000,000th transaction today after 13 years of 100% uptime. It's rare to find any real fundamentals in crypto, much less long term relative growing fundamentals in a coin with bad relative price action. Litecoin is deep clucking value. It's worth digging into the transaction growth trends over the past few years. There's only one altcoin, only one dino with sustained real world user growth and adoption vs everything, even against Bitcoin. It's Litecoin.  

The nice thing about Litecoin is you can confirm onchain data using offchain data. With premined smart contracts you have two layers of deception in the data. First is outright fraud. Preminers can't sell without collapsing the mcap of their chain, but they can put coins into the contracts and just spin them around to create the illusion that there's more activity than there is. They can also use the value of the premine to temporarily support unsustainable incentives, yield farming.   

Real world adoption can be seen offchain as well as onchain, in exchanges, payment processors, retailers, banks, brokerages, atms and the like. Most coins get just enough infrastructure and struggle to add more. Litecoin has over the past few years kept pace with the likes of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin in terms of additions, without the billionaire support, just with users. Sustained additions suggest there's ample liquidity to make it worth retaining support and adding more.  

Over the last few years, Litecoin has added Paypal, Venmo, Paxos, Verifone, bitpay, AMC, Regal, Newegg, Flexa, Gemini, Interactive Brokers, Coinshares, Wisdom Tree, Grayscale, Shopify, Moneygram, postfinance, bitgo, Wisdomtree, Coinme, EDX, Fidelity and even banks like BBVA, BanColumbia and CBA. It's first US ETF application was filed by Canary Capital late last year. That's above and beyond the table stakes of near universal exchange support.  

Among entities reporting user share, Litecoin has really excelled. Litecoin remains the top altcoin among ATMs worldwide, which you can see at coinatmradar. Litecoin has grown it's share at outlets like Coingate and Bitrefill. Most impressively, Litecoin has done at the oldest crypto payment processor what no alt has ever done and taken the top slot from Bitcoin.  

Bitpay, around since 2011, dragged its feet adding Litecoin for years adding other alts, then in 2021 it finally added LTC. It took LTC 3 months to exceed all other altcoin's share. It took maybe a year to exceed all altcoins combined. Then 2 years in it exceeded Bitcoin's share for the first time and last year exceeded Bitcoin's share the entire year, without interruption.  

Litecoin is the values compatible Medium of Transaction companion to Bitcoin's Store of Value. No other coin combines the no premine, fair distribution, algo dominant PoW, fixed supply, global network effect growth with affordable fees. You don't have to hope the centralized preminers don't rug and kill it, they can't because Litecoin shares Bitcoin's decentralization priority. You can see the substitution over the years whenever Bitcoin fees rise, so it's not my opinion, it's the opinion of Bitcoin users drawn to it for the same values. I'd encourage everyone to follow wlitecoin on Twitter/x to learn more about monetization limits and the onchain stats comparisons.  

Litecoin is the boring financial plumbing that has proven it can't be killed by sustained investor hostility, or even slowed. Negative narratives will persist until they fall apart, and the narratives don't match the adoption. 2025 could be ≈Åit.': Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)

Validation error for post 'US crypto hodlers: You have about 2 weeks before the 1099-DA goes into effect. Just a friendly reminder:

Starting January 1st, 2025 (in 2 weeks), all US exchanges (e.g. Kraken, Coinbase) will start reporting your crypto transactions directly to the IRS via the [1099-DA](https://gordonlaw.com/learn/form-1099-da/).

For pretty much the entire existence of crypto so far, US users have had to self report crypto gains on their taxes (many didn't, or simply underreport). But if you have any sale transactions next year (2025) within the exchange of your choosing, they will automatically be reported to the IRS.

Especially noteworthy: If you have coins that you've held for a long time (e.g. from this year or before) and you sell them next year, the IRS will see that you have **$0 cost basis**. And you will have to show them when you acquired your coins (if it's been too long and you somehow can't find these transactions, then too bad, the IRS will just auto-calculate your cost basis as $0).

For example, if you held DOGE from 2020 and your cost basis is $0.002 (and DOGE is now $0.40), you'll have to provide the 2020 transaction where you bought DOGE for $0.002 and pay all the capital gains on the difference. Plus they'll likely audit your other trades from back then and bill you for any other unreported gains.

**TL;DR**: you have about 2 weeks to tidy up your books, lock in your gains, and make sure you have crypto and USD exactly where you want them to be when January 1st rolls around.': Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)

* $1 Doge before $100k Bitcoin
* $10k ETH before $100k Bitcoin
* $4 Algo before $100k Bitcoin
* $5 Cardano before $100k Bitcoin
* $100 Link before $100k Bitcoin.
* $100 Dot before $100k Bicoin

Bitcoin is edging $100K none of the alts are close to their 2021 target. Hell somehow Doge is the closest of all of those at 40% while others alts are barely 6% (looking at you ALGO) of their 2021 $100k BTC target.

With this new cycle new bull targets are already being set up -

* I believe ETH will hit $10k before Bitcoin hits $300k
* I believe Algo will hit $1 before Bitcoin hits $300k

Validation error for post 'Are there even any coins in the top 200 that aren't gonna pump? Most coins typically pump in a bullmarket (more or less). So the question is, are there any coins you can see that could do bad or under-perform significantly? We've seen in past bullruns that even really bad tech, bad tokenomics, bad projects, and useless projects can have huge pumps with the rest of the market, and do really well.

Even coins that had 51% attacks, had scandals, were pretty much scams, still pumped.

But are there any coins that could vastly underperform for a big chunk of the bull market?

# What would it even take for a coin to perform poorly during a bullrun?

In the bullrun of 2021, we only had a few top market cap crypto that ran into problems and vastly underperformed.

ICP was one of the most notable ones.

It go listed on Coinbase, and skyrocketed to over $700 to an insane market cap in a matter of minutes. But then tanked through the entire bullrun.

This was an exceptional case of a bad introductory price point.

Bitcoin BSV had a big pump at the beginning of the bullrun, and then crashed prematurely and never recovered, in a quick pump and dump. It had a series of crises and then started to get delisted.

We saw a few premature crashes for cryptos like GRT.

It's not always for obvious reasons, and more for bad circumstances, making it a little harder to predict.

# Which crypto are more likely to underperform or have a premature crash?

Since it seems to be linked to some nasty surprises more than anything, it's very hard to predict.

If there's anything that's gonna derail, it's more likely a less solid project outside the top 100. There's plenty of crypto there already set up for their own crises.

This doesn't mean the top 100 is immune.

There's some shaky stuff in the top 100.

You already have tokens for questionable exchanges like GateIO.

You have newcomers in the meme world like cat in dog's world, Goatseus Maximus, dogwif hat, and Popcat. I think the meme coin of the SOL ecosystem is one that could really backfire. But I can also see it performing insanely well initially. And then it will end badly in what will be branded as the "Solapocalypse".

I think there will always be a couple of coins that no one expected would perform that badly, that will run into an unexpected crisis, despite being big projects.': Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)

I heard it was going up and from what i believe, i thought so too. It's Trump coin. I had my money in nothing since i was waiting for Bitcoin to lower a bit. I put 100k in Trump coin. Immediately i was down 3k, okay whatever, but not only that, just the feeling of "i fucked it up" was there at the back of my mind. A few hours later my brother (who bought it earlier) messaged me saying it was going down to shit. My stomach couldn't handle it and i was affraid to look. I was going to bed stressed and tried to sleep. Today i woke up and saw the damage. I was down -20%. Which isn't that bad since it recovered from -50% in the night. 25k is a little less than a year of salary. So that was a big kick in the nuts. At work, I saw it was still going down, so I sold and put it in Bitcoin again.

- I did not stick with my original plan.

- I let emotions take the better of me.

- I did not do research.

- It let myself get hyped up.

I am very mad at myself and i let myself down. Not only did i lose 25k, I also missed the potential gains from Bitcoin. I already made peace with it and decided to just stick to Bitcoin only, it's what i have done from the beginning and one of the few that actually worked for me. I trust Bitcoin. I'll do what i have always done to repair the damage.

With all the talk about the Trump memecoin, aren't these memecoins basically the same thing as other collectibles from the past?  Basically like the same thing as if Marvel Comics  releases a limited run of 500 versions of a comic book with a special variant cover?  Or chase cards in various forms of collectible cards (baseball, pokemon, etc.)?

Except a memecoin has a built in exchange and a way to sell it.  Like if I took a "valuable" comic book and tried to purchase goods or services with it, it would be hard because the other person doesn't know what it is worth.  And they worry there is information asymmetry that might cause them to overvalue the comic book.  Plus, they don't actually want to OWN the comic book and then have to sell it on eBay......which is a pain in the butt and (again) they are not a comic book merchant and might not price it correctly.

Isn't a Trump coin the same basic thing......except it is easy to check the value and easier to convert back into a currency you prefer (like bitcoin or US dollars)?  And with blockchain preventing counterfeiting (which can be a problem with other collectibles)?

Edit - Thanks a lot folks.  You basically confirmed what I suspected.  And - to be clear - I have no interest in buying memecoins.  I did buy comic books in my youth and do remember how valuable some of the old issues got......but that was true rarity.  It was from an era when comics were sold to children and mostly ended up rumpled up in a backpack.  Then the comic companies realized that "collectors" would buy more if they restarted Spider Man with a ALL NEW #1 issue and a bunch of limited edition variants of the #1 issues.....except now it wasn't children buying them.....it was adult men buying them and immediately sending them away to be "graded" and encased in lucite.  And then they would release ANOTHER ALL NEW #1 about 18 months later and the cycle would repeat and repeat......and you can guess how much those "collectible" comics are worth now.  You find them at comic shops in what's called the "dollar box" which is a box were any comic is a $1: It's junk.  I'm sure baseball cards are similar.  Heck, US postage stamps are similar: Postal service mostly prints stamps for collectors now.  I mean....stamps COULD be used on actual mail, but almost none are: Collectors buy them, bring them immediately home and put them in the collection......and they're only worth anything to another collector (who probably also bought them from the post office when they were new, lol).

Validation error for post 'So no one really knows anything about anything what do we do? Since the news of Trump came into play we have seen crypto do some massive jumps and some serious dives (*cough* Trump coin). Lots of hype again and now that everyone and the mouse under your fridge know what crypto is, speculation is at an all time high. 

What do we really know? 

Trump is favouring crypto and is playing the game to help himself and everyone he knows make money. Trump is a business man do not forget this when you are speculating. With the new order we do not see a massive immediate spike in crypto. So why not? 

1) BTC, XRP and other popular coins already shot up leading into inauguration. If you truely believe big players were not aware of Trump's plans and did not already price in the news (hence spike) then you need to buy into whatever you are debating now. 

2) the order did not specify a coin. Yes it is likely to be BTC or BTC with a combination of other coins.  BUT it's Trump, I wouldn't rule out them going balls to the wall with a random coin but I do think it's unlikely.  However, I also wouldn't rule out him ripping a line and creating some brand new US digital currency to back the economy on and run against BTC. 

3) Japanese interest rate decision. This is coming up tomorrow and there is speculation they are going to raise to a 17 year high. 

So why BTC, ETH or even XRP? 

BTC is BTC everyone knows what it is and it is finite. Like anything society has attributed value to it and it's rarity makes it valuable. This is the logical option and would echo back to the days when the US dollar was backed by gold. I would even dare to say that if the US did not select this as their coin that BTC would still hold value.  Maybe not where it's at now but it will not become worthless. It is worth considering that a lot of big companies are increasing their BTC holdings (MSTR). Betting big with big US companies is a bit comforting. 

ETH is a similar sentiment but has lost a lot of its appeal post COVID but with it being the second runner up I wouldn't rule out it seeing a play in the digital reserves.  It's also possible that if BTC is chosen that ETH could ragain popularity as a secondary cheaper option causing a run. 

What about XRP? This is a coin I hear a lot of positives about. A lot of hopium and a lot of logical arguments for it. It's cheap enough that many hope it will be the next BTC and make overnight millionaires. If you are new to the coin some of the strongest arguments are it's technology. It can settle transactions reliably and quickly posing a real possibility of it being used like your money today. There are other pros but I want to highlight some of the cons. It is still at the centre of a lawsuit...yes it may get dropped but keep it in mind. It's also unclear is XRP is a finite resource  like BTC or ETH and seems to act more like printed money.  Meaning that it can be the victim of inflation. PERSONALLY I would love to see this coin soar but to me it feels like backing a dollar with another dollar.  It just doesn't making sense so me. 

Plainly crypto will not be a sure bet until something is signed saying that XYZ coin(s) are being used as a reserve. You will be gambling if you want to jump into anything crypto right now.  Then again so was everyone that bought into crypto before the boom and that made people very rich. 

I'm not going to tell you do your due diligence as a way cushion what I said above. Do what you want I'm not your parent but if you have a lower risk appetite but still want to gamble on a possible boom I would suggest you start investing in AI instead.

A long, long time ago,
Crypto gains were on the go,
And Bitcoin made us all feel fine.
But then Trump said, "I‚Äôve got a plan,
A coin to save this crypto land,"
And $TRUMP coin launched‚Äîa joke divine.

But January made me shiver,
The blockchain froze; the trades didn‚Äôt deliver.
Bad tweets on my timeline;
My wallet‚Äôs flat‚ÄîI‚Äôm out of time.

I can't remember if I cried,
When $TRUMP coin nosedived worldwide,
But something touched me deep inside,
The day the market died.

Chorus
So bye-bye to my digital pie,
Put my savings in a token that I thought wouldn‚Äôt die.
And good ol‚Äô boys were tweeting ‚ÄúHODL or cry,‚Äù
Saying, ‚ÄúThis‚Äôll moon; just give it a try.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis‚Äôll moon; just give it a try.‚Äù

Verse 2
Did you read the white paper, man?
It promised gains across the land,
But the roadmap seemed a little vague.
And Trump said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the greatest coin,
The best since gold or fillet mignon‚Äî
It‚Äôs huge, believe me; join the brigade!‚Äù

Well, the miners failed, and the servers crashed,
And the blockchain got hacked‚Äîgone in a flash.

Now I can‚Äôt even buy at the store,
And my savings walked right out the door,
The day the market died.

Saying, ‚ÄúThis‚Äôll moon; just give it a try.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis‚Äôll moon; just give it a try.‚Äù

Verse 3
Now for months, we‚Äôve all been in despair,

While Doge kept climbing out of spite.
And the SEC came crashing in,
Called $TRUMP coin ‚Äúfraud‚Äù with a knowing grin,
And crypto bros all gave up the fight.

Oh, and as I scrolled the Reddit threads,
I saw the memes of tears unsaid,
No comments could be seen,
On r/Crypto‚Äôs dying stream.

And as the market burned into the night,
I cursed that tweet and the orange light,
That coin destroyed my future bright,
The day the market died.

Outro
I met a guy who mined for gold,
And I asked him if his story‚Äôs told,
But he just frowned and walked away.
I went back home to check my app,
No gains, no hope, just a big collapse,
And my crypto dreams are gone today.

And on Twitter, the users screamed,
‚ÄúWe should‚Äôve stayed with index schemes!‚Äù
Not a word was spoken,
The blockchain‚Äôs broken.

And the man who sold us all the dream,
He‚Äôs golfing now with his NFT team,
And I just sat there, lost in a meme,
The day the market died.

Final Chorus
